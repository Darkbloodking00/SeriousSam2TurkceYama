Welcome to M'Digbo, Sam! 
Considering what the Wizards said, I think we should find the M'keke Village and ask their Chief about the medallion. 
There may be obstacles blocking your path. This can be dealt with by the use of objects. To pick up, or use a specific object, press the Use button. 
My sensors detect that the village is on the other side of the mountain. A monkey's head marks the cave entrance, that should take you to the other side. 
Search this settlement in front of us, maybe you can find some useful stuff.
