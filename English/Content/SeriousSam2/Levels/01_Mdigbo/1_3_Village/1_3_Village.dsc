Quickly Sam! Stop the invasion and protect the Simba Chief. If we lose him, we won't be able to find the Shaman.
Also, think about the children, the Primitives won't take any prisoners. They will probably strike from all sides, so try to cover as much ground as you can.
The Simbas are very scared, so don't expect any help. However, if you show them the Primitives are easily beaten, their ancient warrior spirits might wake up.
