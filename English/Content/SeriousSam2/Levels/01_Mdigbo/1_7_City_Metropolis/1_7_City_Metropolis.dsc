Well, Shaman said he will meet us at the ceremonial arena. I scanned the layout of the city, and it seems that all main streets lead towards it.
If we don't wander off in some unknown direction, we will surely find it.
There are three uphill sections of the city, so it will take you some time on foot. Look around, maybe you can find some useful vehicles.
