Great job on defending that village, Sam. Hope you'll make good use of the parrot they gave you.
Anyways, we are now on the right track to the city of Ursul. But there is a long stretch from here to the Main Gates. Finding some transportation could help you.
As you can see, Mental's minions have a small base here. More of them are surely nearby so proceed with caution. Maybe you can use their equipment against them.
