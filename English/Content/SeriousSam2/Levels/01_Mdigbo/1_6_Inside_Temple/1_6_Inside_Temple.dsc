Well, as the sign said, "Luckys Imprisoned Shamans", I don't think we will find an orphanage here. The Shaman is right in front of us.
As it is a prison, more captives must be around. If we free them, I'm sure they will help us.
Proceed with caution, you can bet there are a number of guards in here.
