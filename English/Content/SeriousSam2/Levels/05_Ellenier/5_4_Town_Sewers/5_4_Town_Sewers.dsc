Ha, I knew we'd sooner or later end up in some sewers. The game just isn't fun without them.
But as quickly as we ended up in these butt droppings, we should find an exit even faster. If it's of any comfort to you, I will tell you that those are no ordinary faeces. No, no, this is royal poo.
And I wonder what Mental's troops would do here anyways. Build an HQ? Kleers I can understand, they have no noses, but what about the others...
