I knew Mental had a trick up his sleeve. This is his the most powerful robot, Hugo.
You'll notice he is equipped with all the latest weaponry, including lasers, rocket launchers and cannon. I'm not saying you can't handle him, just be careful.
A good tactical advantage would be gained by getting him out of the hangar. You'll have more room to maneuver. And never, but never, approach him too close. You'll be dead in no time.
Be sure to keep safe distance.
