Great, don't you just love prison facilities? All you get to do is walk the dark corridors, open heavy metallic doors and shoot around. Where did the love go?
Like I said on the way here, sorry if I misbehaved. That Princess can really bring you back to reality. 
Ok, back to saving the universe. What we need to do here is try to release all prisoners and gain control over the hangars and the equipment. With that stuff we'll manage to get ourselves a fleet of fighters, and bang the crap outta Sirius.
The airfield is on the other side of the mountain, and you need to pass a tunnel connecting the prison facilities, Airfield and Hangar area.
It won't be an easy task, as I detected a number of defense turrets in high positions. So, you should watch your every step, ok?
