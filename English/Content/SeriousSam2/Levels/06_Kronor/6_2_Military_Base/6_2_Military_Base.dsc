Well done, Sam, you released most of the prisoners. There are a couple of prison cells in this area, so it would be great if you release those guys too.
Well, after we pass this first courtyard, we will be getting into the Airfield area. There are a number of hangars and big crates containing weapons and technology. With the released prisoners, we can capture enemy Jet Fighters and do a direct strike on Sirius.
