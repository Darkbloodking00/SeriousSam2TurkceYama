Isn't it cold? Good thing you brought something warm to wear, right?
The Alliance fleet is on its way to Sirius. We must find the Laser Cannon to open a gap in Sirius' shield. The Cannon is hidden in one of the mountain hangars.
I took a sneak peak while we were approaching the base, and it seems there are a number of thermal outlets that relieve the steam from the Laser Cannon room. You can warm yourself there.
We have to get to the other side of that perimeter wall. I saw an elevated landing pad over there. You must secure it, and the Alliance troops will drop off a sizable amount of explosives, that we will use to blast the doors leading to the Central Laser Cannon Chamber.
Lets do it!
