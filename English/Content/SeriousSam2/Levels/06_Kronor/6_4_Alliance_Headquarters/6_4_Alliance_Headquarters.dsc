Great, we have the explosives!
Now, all we have to do is cross the base, and blast the gates to the mountain hangars. Of course it won't be as easy as that, but I think you got the hang of it by now.
The resistance will probably be strong, but I don't think Mental deployed any of his bigger experiments, so you'll probably deal with smaller ones.
The gates are located on a small hill, directly built into the mountain. We should have no trouble finding and blasting them.
