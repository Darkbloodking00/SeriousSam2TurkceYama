He he, did you see the brave Alliance Warriors? They kicked the crap outta Mental's minions. Too bad about that pilot a few minutes ago.
Well, we are now on the other part of the city, but the problem is we'll have to go through main squares and streets. And there's bound to be thousands of Soldiers and gangs. Feels like we'll get that "Warriors" experience here. We have to catch a ride that will take us to Mental's Institution. Once we get there, nothing can stop us.
Please be careful. I scanned the streets and found a number of vehicles scattered around.
Use them whenever you can. Good luck!
