Ok, we are getting near the Shield Generator Building.
As you can see we are still in an industrial facility, so we have to get past the Hangars. There are Hover Train Rails that go throughout the area, so we can use one of the service platforms to reach the Generator. We can find one at the Hover Train Station that is just next to the hangars.
If we follow this path, we should get there in no time. But, beware, after all we are in enemy territory, and there is nobody to help us. Plus, they are looking for us.
Proceed with caution.
