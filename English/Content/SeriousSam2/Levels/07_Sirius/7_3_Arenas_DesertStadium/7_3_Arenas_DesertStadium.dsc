I can't believe you got us nicked, over one lousy banana.
Anyways, we are now stuck in this TV show from hell. Let's just try to get out of this alive, maybe the Alliance warriors and the Wizards will manage to do something.
As far as I've understood, the point of these challenges is to run through all checkpoints in a given time, preferably alive. Once we complete them all, maybe they'll let us go.
Good thing is, that they didn't take the medallion from us, so if we manage to escape, we can still hurt Mental.
