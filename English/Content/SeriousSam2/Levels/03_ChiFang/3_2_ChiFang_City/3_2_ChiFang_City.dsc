YAY,  Chan's Amusement Park. I think we can have a lot of fun here. Too bad the place is crawling with enemies.
Once we pass the Park, if we proceed straight, we should eventually find a square where the birthday party is being held.
Then, the only thing left to do is beat the crap, pardon, medallion out of Chan. Or simply splatter his guts all over the place.
