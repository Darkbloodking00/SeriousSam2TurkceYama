Great, he escaped. The situation just got complicated. Now we have to go through all those whacked out Chambers Of Chanolin. Good thing that most of them are redecorated, so we only have to pass a few of them. But don't take that as a good thing, you see we'll probably be attacked from all sides.
After we pass the interior chambers, we will come out on the training grounds. There you will have enough room to play with your Rocket Launcher.
