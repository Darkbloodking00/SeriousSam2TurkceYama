Mate was the long lost twin brother Sam never had. The story about Mate's life can be described as great Rock' n' Roll adventure. Sam's parents lost Mate in the SuperMall when he was just a baby. Rich TV producer Maaronn Telling adopted him, providing lil' Mate with a life of luxury. But that wasn't good enough for teenager Mate; his rebellious soul drove him from trouble to trouble, from prison to prison, from adventure to adventure. During all that time Sam and Mate didn't know about each other, Sam's parents didn't brag about loosing Mate while Tellings didn't want anyone to know they adopted a child. The only thing he had in common with Sam (besides the same left foot being bigger than the right, having the same age, same face and birthmark in a delicate place) was a passion for cooking. Mate decided to put wild life behind him and with daddy's help started a cooking channel. One day, between 2 half's of the intergalactic drinking contest finals, Sam spotted "himself" on the Cooking channel. For the first few weeks he was confused, because he couldn't remember being on TV nor cooking pork for breakfast. Finally Sam met Mate, they compared birthmarks and confronted the Tellings. Mate was so hurt that he didn't know the truth that he demolished his parent's house. That was one of his "I am going mental" attacks, from which he got the nickname "Mental". Sam and Mate are now inseparable trying to catch up the lost childhood.
