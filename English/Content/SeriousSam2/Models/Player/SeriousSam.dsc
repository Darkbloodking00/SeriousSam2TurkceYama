There is limited information about his early life. Even the information that does exist is very contradictive. One thing that is known for certain is that he always wore his famous outfit. Red sneakers, blue jeans and T-shirt with the bomb logo are appearing even in his earliest known pictures. Many witnessed him being very charitable, leading the blind across a street, shopping for elderly and repairing broken toys for children. Others report that they saw him stealing apples from the neighbor's yard, painting bomb logos on fresh facades and even freeing animals from the ZOO. But, no matter what the truth is, everybody agrees that whatever he did, he did it in style.
Overall, he was much like you and me, with one single difference. We have always dreamt about being a lonesome hero that will save the Earth from some invincible Evil. He is that hero. Maybe the last of its kind.
Seriously.
