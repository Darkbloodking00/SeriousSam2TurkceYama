Yollanda 'The Sonic' Youth was a bouncer in a trendy Zagreb night-club. Kicking butts of drunken male customers was all she lived for. She fell for Sam Stone, a frequent guest of such places. At the beginning, their relationship flourished, papers wrote cover stories, national TV station CTV (Croatian telepathic vision) even had a reality show called "They are dating, come and watch, there's nothing better on tv anyway". With war knocking on Earth's door, Sam neglected Yollanda more and more in exchange for guns. Sam left Earth without even saying "Goodbye my darling" or "I love you more than anything". Yollanda became an emotional wreck, so she stopped eating and dressing properly. But boy, was she surprised when Sam contacted her from M'digbo asking her to join him in the fight against Mental. Now people call them Bunnie and Kyle, as they are inseparable in the quest to defeat evil.
