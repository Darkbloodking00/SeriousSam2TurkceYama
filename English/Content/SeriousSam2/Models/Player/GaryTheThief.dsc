Now, this is one sad sad story. You can call him CIP (character in progress) as he still hasn't got a chance to star in the Serious Sam game. His appearance changed from encounter to encounter, from nude, primitive outfit in The First Encounter, through latex costume in The Second Encounter and finally he got "Anarchy in Gospich" look. Unfortunately, his role in the game was blurred and unclear to game designers, so he developed a manic depression in the last few years.  To save him from faded stardom, good angels from the Art department, sneaked him in the game as a multiplayer character. Since then, he is fighting in cooperative mode along with Serious Sam, Mate and other characters.
