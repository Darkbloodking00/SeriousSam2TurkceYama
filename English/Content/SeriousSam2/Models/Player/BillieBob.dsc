Some people are "rebels without cause", Billy Bob (B.B.B. for the friends) was "biker without driving license". He got it all, the looks, the outfit but bike was missing. Why you ask ? Well, reason was that he was afraid of any ways of transportations but foot driven ones. Despite all that he was very popular among bikers community in his university, MIT (Massachusetts institute of technology) . Bob would tell stories about his "travels" around country, his "encounters" with beautiful women, his "bar fights" and so on. Things were going great until guys in his fraternity "Alpha Alpha Beta", bought him real bike for his birthday. His image was shattered to pieces and the only escape from cruel world was to join EAM (Earth against Mental) forces. Rumors float around space that he got driving license, some even wilder rumors talk about him being seen driving bike!
